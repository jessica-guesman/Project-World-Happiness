Abstract:  We investigated whether the variables (listed below) are related to the general happiness score of the sample group from various countries. 
Variables that were including in the data to generate the happiness score were GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and corruption perception. 
Our data was collected from the Gallup World Poll (GWP). We used multiple linear regressions to build a ladder score to predict for happiness. 
The purpose of our project is to use all the methods we studied in class and apply them to predict a ladder score for the year 2022.
