Target and Independent Variables:
Target is ladder score (happiness), and variables include GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and corruption perception 


Comparison groups would be the 2020 and 2021 csv files with the data.

For the project, we will be using multiple linear regressions to build a ladder score in order to predict for happiness. Along with this method, steps such as backwards elimination must take place.



```{r}
plot(x = df$Social.support, y = df$Ladder.score)
```
This code represents the scatter plot that was created showing the relationship between the social support variable and the ladder score. In this scatterplot, there is a positive relationship with a potential parabloa. We can conclude off the scatter plot that the higher the social support, the higher the ladder score typically.

```{r}
plot(x = df$Healthy.life.expectancy, y = df$Ladder.score)
```
This code represents the scatter plot that was created showing the relationship between the healthy life expectancy of a person and their ladder score. This scatterplot has a positive correlation and shows that the higher the healthy life expectancy, the higher the ladder score.

```{r}
plot(x = df$Logged.GDP.Per.capita, y = df$Ladder.score)
```
This code shows the scatterplot of the relatiosnip of the logged GDP per capita and the ladder score. There was a postive correlation showing that the higher the logged GDP per captia, the higher the ladder score.

```{r}
plot(x = df$Freedom.to.make.life.choices, y = df$Ladder.score)
```
This code shows the scatterplot that represents the relationship between the freedom to make life choices and the ladder score. There is a positive correlation, meaning that the higher the freedom to make life choices was, the higher the ladder score was.

```{r}
plot(x = df$Generosity, y = df$Ladder.score)
```
This code shows the scatterplot of the relationship between the generosity of the person and the ladder score. This scatterplot really did not have a distinct relationship between the two variables.

```{r}
plot(x = df$Perceptions.of.corruption, y = df$Ladder.score)
```
This code shows the scatterplot between the perceptions of corruption and the ladder score. There is a negative correlation in this scatterplot, meaning that the higher the perception of corruption, the lower the ladder score was.

At a first glance the scatterplots show what we would expect, however it was interesting seeing how the generosity variable showed no distinct relationship. The other variables that are being used to create the ladder score were showing very disntinct correlations that we expected to occur.
