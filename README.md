# Project-World-Happiness
This is a project for DS 300 Methods of Data Science. It was conducted by myself, Jessica Guesman, and my partner Zachary VonStein.
In this project we took a dataset from Kaggle containing data from a world happiness poll, and we decided to build models to helps predict happiness from
the given varaibles in the data set. We performed data cleaning and used 7 varaibles from this data set(social support, healthy life expectancy, perceptions of corruption, freedom to make life choices, generosity and logged gdp per capita, to predict ladder score or happiness scores. We created a multiple regression model and a polynomial regression model, and
compared the models to by looking at the adjusted R squared values produced. We came to the conclusion that since the polynomial regression model had a higher Adjusted R squared value
of .763, compared to that of the multiple regression model with an adjusted R squared value of .7388. Both are decents predictors of happiness, however we concluded that 
polynomial regression is better at predicting world happinesss.
